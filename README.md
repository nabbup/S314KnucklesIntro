# Raine's Sonic 3'14-like Knuckles AIZ Intro
not really a mod intended to be that stable, but whatever.
it makes the AIZ intro for Knuckles more like the [Sonic 3 2014 Proof of Concept Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct1cErthI6s) released by Christian Whitehead.
probably *really* incompatible with level mods, especially stuff like D.A. Garden Edition or mods that replace all the chunks in AIZ.
